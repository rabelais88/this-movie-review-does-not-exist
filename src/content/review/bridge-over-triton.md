_Protecting bridges, both literal and metaphorical, is typically a theme reserved for earthbound stories. In "Bridge Over Triton," director George Lucas has ambitiously extended it to the outer reaches of our solar system. Released in 2023, it pits Angelina Jolie, Daniel Day-Lewis, and Tom Hardy in a space opera of epic proportions. Think 'Rogue One' meets 'A Room.'_

The narrative revolves around a perilous mission to avert planetary wallop of Neptune's largest moon, Triton. Jolie's Captain Valeri, Day-Lewis' scientist Dr. Kieldros, and Hardy's eclectic alien Pexx form a fractious alliance, their conflicting motivations mirroring the enormous gravitational forces around them. Their mission – to safeguard the Intergalactic Bridge Control Station – forms the main crux of the plot. Jolie's performance is striking as she articulates the internal conflict of a disciplined military figure facing insurmountable odds.

The film's cinematography is hypnotizing. Lucas notably parallels the infinite expanse of the cosmos with the interpersonal distances between his characters. A notable scene is the one where we see Valeri and Kieldros engaged in a heated debate, centered on the ethics of sacrificing few for many, as Pexx views the Milky Way dilating outside the gargantuan windows. These visuals provide a captivating backdrop for the intellectually stimulant screenplay, crafted masterfully by Emma Donoghue. The discourse on the ethics of survival is at once reminiscent of Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' and the unfiltered emotionality of 'Bridges of Madison County.'

Despite its compelling themes and performances, 'Bridge over Triton' does stumble a bit in its pacing, with the second act losing some momentum. But, the slow burn leads to an explosive climax, intricately webbed with Jolie's heartfelt monologue and Lucas' signature visual drama, rekindling the thrill in the audience.

To sum it up, 'Bridge over Triton' is a powerful space-drama. Its shortcomings don't wholly detune the praiseworthy performances and thought-provoking themes. Sit back and prepare for a gripping interstellar journey where the survival of humanity hangs in the tense silence of deep space. Just remember, in space, no one can hear you applaud.
